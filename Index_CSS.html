                <h1>Q3 2023</h1>





                <p>This quarter’s key compliance news includes cases on money-laundering, market manipulation and
                    violation
                    of
                    record-keeping rules. </p>

                <h1>About $1b in cash, assets seized and frozen in one of Singapore’s biggest anti-money laundering
                    operations</h1>

                <p>In one of the biggest anti-money laundering operations, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) rounded up a
                    group of foreigners who had amassed about $1 billion worth of assets in Singapore.
                    The assets, which included properties, luxury cars and goods, were either seized, frozen or issued
                    with
                    prohibition of disposal orders. The group lived in good class bungalows (GCBs) and high-end
                    condominiums, and owned luxury cars.
                    The police said it received information of possible illicit activities, including suspected forged
                    documents used to substantiate the source of funds in Singapore bank accounts. A massive islandwide
                    blitz was conducted on 15 August 2023, hitting several GCBs and high-end condos across Singapore
                    simultaneously to nab several of the suspects. The areas raided included Tanglin, Bukit Timah,
                    Orchard
                    Road, Sentosa and River Valley.
                    Ten people, including a woman, were arrested and charged on 16 August 2023 night. They are aged 31
                    to
                    44, and are suspected to be involved in offences of forgery, money laundering and resisting arrest.
                    Another 12 are assisting in investigations, while eight more people are currently on the run and
                    have
                    been placed on a wanted list. - Singapore money laundering and forgery AML probe</p>

                    in WTI Futures</h1>
                <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued an order on 1 August 2023 simultaneously filing and
                    settling charges against UK-based trader
                    Adam Cobb-Webb for engaging in multiple instances of spoofing in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light
                    sweet crude oil futures contracts traded on New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX) from
                    approximately December 16, 2021 through at least January 14, 2022.
                    The order requires Cobb-Webb to pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty and imposes a one-year ban
                    from
                    trading on or subject to the rules of any CFTC-designated exchange and all other CFTC-registered
                    entities and in all commodity interests.
                    Cobb-Webb is also ordered to cease and desist from violating the spoofing prohibition in the
                    Commodity
                    Exchange Act (CEA).
                    “This order is the latest in a long series of actions by the Commission to punish spoofing in the
                    markets the Commission oversees,” said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. “Spoofing is easier
                    than
                    ever for the Commission to identify and pursue. Our message to would-be spoofers is this: Don’t.” –

                <h1>US regulators fine Wall Street firms $549 mln in latest texting probe</h1>
                <p>U.S. regulators have fined nine Wall Street companies, including Wells Fargo (WFC.N), BNP Paribas
                    (BNPP.PA) and Société Générale (SOGN.PA) $549 million over employees’ use of personal messaging apps
                    to
                    discuss deals, trades and other business. The penalties mark the latest wave of a sweeping two-year
                    enforcement probe targeting Wall Street’s use of so-called “off channel” work communications such as
                    text and WhatsApp messages in breach of rules which require firms to retain certain work-related
                    communications.
                    Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, SocGen,
                    the Bank of Montreal, (BMO.TO), boutique brokers Wedbush Securities, Moelis & Company, and Houlihan
                    Lokey, and Japanese brokers Mizuho and SMBC Nikko Securities agreed to pay a combined $289 million
                    to
                    the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the agency said. Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas,
                    SocGen,
                    BMO, and Wedbush will pay a further $260 million to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
                    for
                    similar violations, the regulator said in a separate statement. All nine firms admitted that from at
                    least 2019 their employees often communicated on personal devices using iMessage, WhatsApp and
                    Signal,
                    the SEC said, in what the regulator said was a “pervasive and longstanding” violation of its
                    record-keeping rules. Wall Street firms fined by US Regulators</p>


                <h2>Key takeaways:</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Never use a personal device or a non-approved communication channel to discuss
                        any in-scope activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>Separate your personal life from your work life - keep work stuff on work systems,
                        and personal stuff on personal devices.

                    </li>
                    <li>Never suggest that a business conversation moves off a recorded system or use jargon to try and
                        avoid surveillance.
